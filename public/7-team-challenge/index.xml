      <description>You will have 3 minutes to fetch as many coins as possible.
 You can re-run your script any number of times within the alloted period. You are not allowed to make changes to your script midway through a run.    There are 5 coin types relevant to this exercise, each made with a different color for easier identification:
 Bitcoin: red Etherium: grey Litecoin: blue Dash: green Monero: yellow    The value of a coin is determined by the price shown on CoinMarketCap at the start of the competition.</description>
