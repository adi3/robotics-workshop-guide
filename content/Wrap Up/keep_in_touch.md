Play around with the ROS application and integrate more AWS services into it. There are several ready-to-use ROS [cloud extensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/robomaker/latest/dg/cloud-services-integration.html) provided by AWS for you to experiment with, and you can build custom ones yourself using the [Boto3 Python SDK](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html).

See how far you can take the tenets of cloud robotics towards benefiting your organization!

Shoot an email to **adsnghw@amazon.com** if you have any questions or feedback. We'd love to hear from you!
